## Project description
Application provides RESTful API for warehouse management. It is built using MVC architecture and SOLID principles.

### Functionalities: 
- Register/login for users
- Management of PZ/WZ documents
- Auto updating items' quantities in warehouse
- CRUD for models

## Some nice things we learnt:
- stairs-line branch stucture,
- unit and integration tests,
- spring boot framework,
- authentication using Spring Security,
- SOLID and clean code practices,
- separation input model from entity model (DTO),
- conventional commits [link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
- Github Action:
    - setting up GA,
    - auto running test before pull requests.

Note: We would NEVER put any secure keys in `application.properties` if this was going to go on production. Consider included file as development configuration.
